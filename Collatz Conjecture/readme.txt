A program about the collatz conjecture , you can see the information in pdf and if you are interested you can google it. 

Collatz conjecture has not been proven yet even though it is seemingly a simple problem. Consider the 
following function:
𝑓(𝑥) = {
3𝑥 + 1 𝑖𝑓 𝑥 𝑖𝑠 𝑜𝑑𝑑
𝑥/2 𝑖𝑓 𝑥 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛
Starting with an integer 𝑥0 the sequence 𝑥1 = 𝑓( 𝑥0
), 𝑥2 = 𝑓( 𝑥1
), … tends end up with a loop 4, 2, 1, 4, 
2, 1… Conjecture says that any starting integer should send this sequence to the same loop. (See 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg for an overview of this conjecture).
